The purpose of this repository is to for me (and other id wanted) to try out and learn code

NOTE:

- All of the following code is not only allowed to be used by anyone but encouraged as a learning resource.
- I am also using this repository to help teach my younger brother python, so most code will stay basic and will be good beginner projects and or code examples
- Have Fun!
